1. Flask: This is the main dependency shared across all the Python files. It is a micro web framework written in Python.

2. SQLAlchemy: This is the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that will be used in "models.py" for database interactions. It is also used in "server.py" for initializing the database.

3. Configurations: "config.py" file will contain all the configuration variables like SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URI etc. These configurations will be imported and used in "server.py" and "app/__init__.py".

4. App: The Flask app instance created in "app/__init__.py" will be imported and used in "server.py", "app/routes.py", "app/models.py" and "app/forms.py".

5. Models: The database models defined in "app/models.py" will be used in "app/routes.py" for handling database operations.

6. Forms: The form classes defined in "app/forms.py" will be used in "app/routes.py" and in the HTML templates for rendering forms.

7. Routes: The routes defined in "app/routes.py" will be used in the HTML templates for creating links.

8. Static Files: The CSS file "app/static/styles.css" will be used in all the HTML templates for styling.

9. Templates: The base layout defined in "app/templates/layout.html" will be extended in all other HTML templates.

10. DOM Elements: The id names of DOM elements in the HTML templates will be used in the JavaScript functions for manipulating the DOM.

11. Message Names: The flash message categories defined in "app/routes.py" will be used in the HTML templates for displaying flash messages.

12. Function Names: The function names defined in "app/routes.py" will be used in the HTML templates for creating URLs.

13. Requirements: The "requirements.txt" file will list all the Python packages required for the app, including Flask and SQLAlchemy.
